Co-developed a machine learning pipeline to identify high-risk roadways in Northern Virginia using traffic crash data from VDOT, targeting safety and infrastructure planning using random forest and neural networks.
Trained and optimized Random Forest models to predict crash severity (RMSE: 0.94) and classify road defects (F1-score: 0.96), significantly outperforming the neural network baseline.

#### Tools: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Random Forest Classifier/Regressor, Matplotlib, Seaborn
